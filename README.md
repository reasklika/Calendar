# Calendar
Welcome to EmberPlan Calendar, a project that was created to help with busy schedules and procrastinating. Here you will find the idea of the project, the user needs analysis, what problems we aim to solve and the prototype of the software. The design of the prototype was created using Figma, a collaborative design tool.
